Hey! 👋

I am a robotics engineer and researcher currently pursuing an <a href='https://www.moro.uni-bonn.de/'>M.Sc. in Mobile Robotics</a> at the <a href='https://www.uni-bonn.de/en'>University of Bonn</a>. 

My work focuses on autonomous systems, robotic perception, and real-time 3D sensing, with an emphasis on building efficient, deployable perception pipelines for real-world robots.

Previously, I worked worked as an **independent researcher and robotics consultant**, focusing on bandwidth-efficient 3D streaming and perception systems for remote robotic navigation, using low-cost stereo hardware, edge AI, and video-based depth representations.

I have also worked at the ERTS Lab, <a href='https://www.iitb.ac.in/'>IIT Bombay</a>, developing and optimizing Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) using <a href='https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/'>ROS 2</a>, <a href='https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-platforms'>NVIDIA Jetson platforms</a>, and multi-modal sensing for outdoor navigation, warehouse automation, and self-driving research.

I have also been actively involved in **robotics mentorship and education** through <a href='https://e-yantra.org/'>e-Yantra</a> at IIT Bombay, mentoring students and interns, designing competition problem statements, and conducting hands-on training programs for faculty and students.

During my time at IIT Bombay as a **Research Intern**, I worked on <a href='https://ravikrcsia.github.io/projects/lcpp/'>LCPP: Low Computational Processing Pipeline for Delivery Robots</a>, leading to a peer-reviewed publication at <a href='https://icaart.scitevents.org/'>ICAART 2022, Vienna</a>.
